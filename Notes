ObjectOutputStream serializes everything passing through, meaning that it transforms the objects into a series of bits. ObjectInputStream then deserializes the bits back into the object.

Serializable means that the class in question can handle doing so. For our intents and purposes, this can be decided by cheching if all the inner objects implement Serializable
